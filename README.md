#EasyMda

EasyMda is an Eclipse plugin that can generate source-code, from a model that is based on Java classes.

The main goal of this project is to provide the:

* most flexible (anything imaginable, can be modelled and generated),
* easiest to develop and to use,
* and also a very fast:
* multi purpose MDA/code-generator tool.

The main difference with other Mda tools is that easyMda does not rely on Uml nor a Dsl, instead it uses Java classes as it's model. The advantage over Uml and Dsl is that the combined power of

* Java reflection (to parse the model classes)
* Interfaces (to provide the generator with whatever information)
* Annotation's (for all kinds of fine-grained information)
* plus the incredible Jet engine
* make it so flexible and powerful.
